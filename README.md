## Try

The full Python code package documented here is still under development.
To try out the pose analysis code in the meantime, we recommend opening
the notebook
[Pose_analysis_examples.ipynb](https://github.com/broadwell/choreo_k_backup/blob/main/Pose_analysis_examples.ipynb)
in Google Colab:

## Documentation

Details of the specific functions of each module are available via the
project [documentation site](https://broadwell.github.io/choreo_k/).

Generally, though, `choreo_k` is intended to provide the pose analysis
~~pipeline~~ routine illustrated in the following figure, in which each
step of the routine can be implemented in one or more different ways,
but each implementation provides roughly equivalent functionality. For
example, different third-party pose detection libraries may be used to
generate pose data, which then can be modified, represented, analyzed
and visualized by any modules that support a specific library’s pose
data output format.
